Custom URL
We have a primary domain 'musicmastereducation.co.nz' managed under Google Admin/Account/Domains/ManageDomains. Squarespace is the registrar.

We have a Google Sites site at sites.google.com/musicmastereducation.co.nz/musicianship-trainer-beta

We want that the content of this Google site be rendered when a user visits musicmastereducation.co.nz

So we tried adding a custom URL to our Google site musicianship-trainer-beta and then see -

Set up CNAME record with your domain host
To use testsite.musicmastereducation.co.nz, follow these steps:

Sign in to your domain hosting service (e.g. Google Domains)
Navigate to your DNS management page for musicmastereducation.co.nz
>>>Find the CNAME settings and enter testsite as the CNAME value or alias
Set the CNAME destination to ghs.googlehosted.com
Save changes and click Add Custom URL below

However there is no CNAME settings available in our domain managment under Google Workspace Admin. Must this setting be done somehow via Squarespace? If so please send the relevant instructions. If so do we have to pay a trqansfer fee to Squarespace?
